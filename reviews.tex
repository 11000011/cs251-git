\section{Review 1: OMG - Oh My God}

OMG! is a full on entertainer with loads of funny moments. The screenplay of the story - inspired by a Gujarati play is written by Umesh Shukla - is brilliant. The screenplay is fast and direction is good. The dialogs are top-notch.

Akshay Kumar as Lord Krishna is charming and affable. Paresh rawal acts with so ease and confidence. He is the main protagonist and does full justice to the role. Mithun Chakrabothy is really funny and so is Govind Namdeo. Applause to a well deserved cast.
